# Project for ChatGPT Writer 

This is a [Plasmo extension](https://docs.plasmo.com/) project bootstrapped with command: `pnpm create plasmo --with-tailwindcss`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

See how to load the extension: https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/dev#loading-the-extension

For further guidance, [visit our Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/).

## Where to edit?

- The main code is located in src/content.tsx. By default, when you run the extension, it displays a static count button on the LinkedIn website. You need to replace it with your own code.

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.
